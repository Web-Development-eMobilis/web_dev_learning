				<h2>Wildlife Conservation Measures</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Trash isn’t just ugly, it’s harmful. Birds can trap their heads in plastic rings. Fish can get stuck in nets. Plus, trash pollutes everyone’s natural resources. Do your part by putting trash in its place and keeping your community clean.
					</li>
					<li>
						Find new ways to use things you already own. Manoh Philip Sesay, a YALI Network member in Sierra Leone, uses discarded plastics to create shopping bags, handbags and computer bags.
					</li>
					<!-- <li>
						Habitat destruction is the main threat to 85 percent of all threatened and endangered species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. You can help reduce this threat by planting native trees or cleaning up beaches in your area.
					</li> -->
					<!-- <li>
						Whether you’re more interested in protecting natural habitats or preventing wildlife trafficking, find the organization that speaks to your passion. If such an organization doesn’t exist in your community, create one!
					</li>
					<li>
						One way to support an organization is to donate your time. Many offer volunteer programs. You can help clean beaches, rescue wild animals or teach tourists about your local habitat.
					</li>
					<li>
						Share your passion for wildlife conservation with your family. Tell your friends how they can help. Ask everyone you know to do what they can to help conserve Africa’s wildlife.
